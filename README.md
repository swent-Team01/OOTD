# OOTD 

## Description
People often have trouble finding easily accessible and up-to-date inspiration for their outfits. 
Style-conscious people and fashion enthusiasts need a place to share their outfit ideas, get 
feedback and find inspiration in others. Our app aims to enable users to be able to share their 
outfit of the day with their friends to inspire them and give new style ideas while also suggesting 
brands to buy viewed items from making it easy to replicate outfits that appear in your feed. Users 
are also able to store their previous outfits and highlight ones that they like best.
